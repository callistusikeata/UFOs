# UFOs

### Overview of Analysis

The purose of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that displays the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. The previous webpage created, only provided users with a date filter. But, for this project, we aimed to allow users filter the data with more than just the date. Additional filters for the table includes city, state, country, and shape.

### Results

Originally, the webpage included only a date filter in which users needed to click on a button for the filter to be applied. With the updated version, users can filter data, simply by inputting a criteria into one of the filter fields. Consequently, the webpage will automatically filter the table to display relevant data. The first image shows the table without filters. Users can see the type of format that is needed for the filter to function in the text box. Upon input, the table will automatically filter the results accordingly.

### Summary of Analysis

One setback of this webpage is that it is currently unable to resize in according to the device it is used on. Some portion of the webpage, such as the image, is able to resize if the user increases the webpage, however, the webpage as a whole is unable to do so. Thus, one recommendation for further development would be to add formatting that readjusts the sections and margins when the page is viewed on a mobile device or tablet.

Another addition recommend to the webpage is a survey form. The survey would ask about the users' experience with extraterrestial sightings. It can include questions such as a description for what they saw, duration, general geographic location, and other interesting details. This way, we can expand our table and database by including new user sightings.
